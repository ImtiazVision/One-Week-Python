# Sets are unordered collections of data with no duplicate(unique) elements. Sets can only contain immutable elements. 
# We can do the followings with sets:
# - Add and delete elements
# - Iterate over elements
# - Check to see if an element is in a set
# - Use set operators: union, intersection etc.
