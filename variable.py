# Variables are like labels for values. We may save a value and assign it a name so that we can go back to it, use it for other purposes, and edit it in the future.

# For example 

score = 433

print("The score is: ", score)

# here score is variable and equal sign (=) is the assignment operator and 433 is the value.

# A variable can't start with a number. A variable name can't contain spaces. A variable name can't contain any python keywords such as for, if, while, def, class, False, await, else, import, pass, None, break, except, in, raise, True, finally, is, return, and, continue, lambda, try, as, from, nonlocal, assert,del, global, not, with, async, elif, or, yield etc.

help('keywords') # This will show us all the keywords in python.
