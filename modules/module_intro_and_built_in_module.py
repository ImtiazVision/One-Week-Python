# Module: A module is simply a Python file that contains code that can be re-used in other files.

# Modules allow us to break up complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces across multiple files. 

# There are 3 types of modules: 1. Built-in 2. Custom 3. 3rd Party

# Built-in Module: Standard Library
# Python comes with tons of built-in modules that we can use, if we import them. Each module consists of methods and functionality bundled together.
