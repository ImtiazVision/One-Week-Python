# If we open a string with the double quotes, we can use single quotes inside the double quotes to quotes a text but must make sure to end the string properly with double quotes.

# If we open a string with the double quotes, we must close it with the double quotes. If we open a string with the single quotes, we must close it with the single quotes. We need to be consistent with the quotes we use.
