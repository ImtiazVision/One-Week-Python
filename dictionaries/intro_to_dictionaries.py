# Dictionaries allow us to store information in key-value pairs. We use dictionaries when order doesn't matter (list is used when order does matter).

# Dictionaries, known as associative arrays in some other languages, are 'indexed by keys' rather than a numerical index. 
# - A dictionary holds key-value pairs
# - Keys can be any immutable data type: numbers, strings, booleans etc.
# - Values can be anything/whatever we want to input.  

#     Key                Value

#  'address'          '111 Main st'
#  'age'                  20
#   'is_admin'          False
#     'email'         'someone@email.com'
