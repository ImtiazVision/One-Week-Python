# The exercise uses the following "peak" dictionary:
peak = {
    "name": "Castle Peak",
    "height": 14264,
    "summit_log": [],
    "cell_reception": {
        "AT&T": "no reception",
        "T-Mobile": "poor"
    }
}
# Without touching the original variable declaration (above)...
# Add a "range" key to peak and set it equal to "Elk Mountains"

# Add a "first_climbed" key to peak and set it equal to 1873

# Whoops, there's a mistake with the peak "height".  Update it to 14265

# Add a "Verizon" to the "cell_reception" dict and set it equal to "good"

# You just summited the peak! Add your name to the "summit_log" list


# Let's rename "height" to "elevation":
# Remove "height" from the dict and store the result in a variable.


# Use the value for "height" and store it in the dict under they key "elevation"


# Loop over the values in the dictionary and print them all out.  Don't ask why, just do it :)


# Loop over the keys AND values in the dictionary and print them all out in the following format:
# key -> value
# (print an arrow between each pair)


# A huge earthquake/meteor/forestfire/tsunami has destroyed the peak.  Please empty out the entire dictionary.
