# Object Oriented Programming: is an approach to Programming that involves modeling 'things' into Python objects. These objects can contain both data AND functionality all wrapped up together into a reusable component.

# For example, we we want to create a chess game, we need to have reusable components such as  match, AIPlayer, Player, Piece, Board etc. 

# Class: Classes are blueprints or recipes that we can later use to create objects from. A class describes what properties and functionality individual objects will contain. 

# Instance: We call the individual objects that are created from a class blueprint are instances. 

# Example of classes: 
# Cupcake recipe: color, frosting, flavor, flour type, recipe instructions etc. all are unique(blueprint) for this cupcake recipe.
# Instances: we can follow the basic rules from the class blueprint but however, we can instantiate them into different color,size, shape of cupcakes. 

# Examples of class:
# Task: has data such as name, description, status, priority, owner. It also has functionality such as assign() and complete()

# Example of instances:
# one instances would be 'Bugfix': Fix the double click bug on home page navbar. It has medium priority and the owner is Theresa.
# another instances derived from that class would be 'Login Ticket': Create  new login screen for app. It has high priority and the owner is Baker.
