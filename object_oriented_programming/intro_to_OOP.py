# Object Oriented Programming is an approach to Programming that involves modeling 'things' into Python objects. These objects can contain both data AND functionality all wrapped up together into a reusable component.

# For example, we we want to create a chess game, we need to have reusable components such as  match, AIPlayer, Player, Piece, Board etc. 

# Class: Classes are blueprints or recipes that we can later use to create objects from. A class describes what properties and functionality individual objects will contain.
