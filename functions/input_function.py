# The input() function is used to get input from the user. It will prompt the user to enter some input, converts it into a string, and returns it. We use a parenthesis with a quotation mark inside the parenthesis. 

color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
print("Your favorite color is " + color + "!!!")
