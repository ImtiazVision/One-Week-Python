# Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be called to do something. To execute a function, we use parenthesis
# these are some examples of functions:
print()
type()
help()

# Arguments are input values that we pass/provide to a function. Argument is a fancy word for inputs. For example, burger(tomato, lettuce,cheese, well_done)
