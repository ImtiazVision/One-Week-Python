# 'intensity' inside the parenthesis is an 'argument/parameter' which ask the user for an input from their end

# here we just came up with the variable name 'intensity'
def laugh(intensity):
  print('HA' * intensity)

# here, we pass 8 as an 'argument' so that 'HA' will be printed 8 times and we don't have to hard code   
laugh(8)


# The terms 'parameter/argument' are used interchangeably, which is merely a variable. 

# 'Parameter' is simply the variable that holds the value/input of the argument.
  
# However, anytime we execute a function, it is referred to as a 'argument' since we call the function with the input provided such as 'laugh(8). Here, '8' is the provided input called as 'argument'.
