# 'intensity' inside the parenthesis is an 'argument/parameter' which ask the user for an input from their end

# here we just came up with the variable name 'intensity'
def laugh(intensity):
  print('HA' * intensity)

# here, we pass 8 as an 'argument' so that 'HA' will be printed 8 times and we don't have to hard code   
laugh(8)


# 'parameter/argument' terminology used interchangeably which is just a variable. 

# 'Parameter' is just the variable that holds the arguments value/input
  
# However, whenever we execute a function, it is called an 'argument' by calling the function with input provided 'laugh(8)'
