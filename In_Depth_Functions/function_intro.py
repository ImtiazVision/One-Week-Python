# Functions are reusable actions that have a name
# Why we use function:
# To prevent code duplication and keep code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)
# To abstract away code, break a complex program down into small pieces

def speak():
  print("*" * 15)
  print("I can speak")
  print("*" * 15)

# calling the function
speak()
